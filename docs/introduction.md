This guide will help you understand the Scout Brand, the local customisations available and how best to use it within your group or unit.

Following branding guidelines allows the movement to have a strong and consistent brand, recognisable to both members and the general public.

The 2018 rebrand focuses on **Skills for Life**, which helps prepare the following for better futures:
* Young people – by giving them the character, employability and practical skills they need to succeed
* Volunteers – by equipping them with better skills, tools and support to deliver inspiring programmes
* Society – by bringing people together and improving the lives of those in our communities.
