District logos with a transparent background are available to download below. Where there's space to do so, aim to use the stacked version of the logo.

Use the purple or black logo _except_ for on coloured or photo backgrounds where the white logo can be used if this has a better contrast.

When using the logos below on a website, you should reduce the size of them to what you need to reduce the file size. You can do this using [Resize a PNG](https://onlinepngtools.com/resize-png) ensuring `Preserve Ratio` is checked.

```hint
You can download customised logos for your group or unit from the [National Scout Brand Centre](https://scoutsbrand.org.uk/catalogue/category/digital/logos/logo-generator). You need to register for an account to access these tools.
